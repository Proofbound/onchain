    "text": "1.1 The Foundation of a New Commercial Civilization\nOnChain Commerce: The Third Commercial Revolution\nIn the past commercial world, “making money” equaled “making profit.” But in the era of OnChain Commerce, “making money” equals “making circulation.” We have discovered that what truly makes people wealthy is not storing money away, but using money in places that generate value exchange. The concept of “spending more to earn more” is not a pipe dream, but a realistic possibility built on blockchain technology and decentralized business logic.\nOnChain Commerce represents an entirely new commercial civilization—not a singular platform, but a business ecosystem centered on value sharing, disintermediation, and trust reconstruction. It doesn’t depend on any single country or company, nor does it center on advertising placement, but is built upon community participation and benefit co-creation.\nOnChain Commerce emerged not to oppose tradition, but to solve long-standing pain points in traditional business systems:\nThese problems aren’t coincidental—they stem from structural issues in our commercial design. OnChain Commerce offers a deployable solution to these core problems.",

    "text": "1.2 From “Earning Money” to “Earning Circulation”\nWhat is “wealth”? In the agricultural era, it was land. In the industrial era, it was capital and factories. In the digital era, it became traffic and attention. But regardless of how times change, one constant remains: true wealth comes from “flow.”\nTraditional economic logic taught us to save money—converting income into bank deposits or real estate assets to ensure future security. However, under inflationary pressure and currency oversupply, the purchasing power of savings declines yearly. What truly brings appreciation is liquidity.\nWhen capital stagnates, it equals loss. When capital creates value through circulation, it not only doesn’t shrink but can bring compound returns. This is the essential logic of “earning circulation”—not storage, but letting money flow, create, and redistribute within the right ecosystem.",

    "text": "1.4 Web3: Restructuring Commercial Rules\nWeb3 represents the next generation of the internet, but what truly changes business rules isn’t just technology—it’s the reconstruction of power structures and value distribution methods.\nTraditional business logic is “centralized”: data belongs to platforms, users are merely data producers, value is captured by platforms, and participants cannot share profits. Rules are set by platforms, with merchants and users only able to accept them.\nWeb3 proposes a disruptive logic: users own data, communities co-govern ecosystems, and value growth is shared.\nThis value sovereignty allows users to truly “own their economic systems,” forcing platforms to reconsider their relationship with participants. Through transparent rules, automatic execution, and fair distribution mechanisms, OnChain Commerce eliminates traditional intermediary exploitation while creating sustainable value growth.",

More importantly, I hope it helps you open an entirely new perspective: in the future, not understanding OnChain Commerce will be like not understanding the internet 25 years ago.\nIn the future business world, circulation is more important than ownership. We stand at the threshold of a real commercial revolution. And you will no longer be just a participant—you are a node in this revolution.\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. The TeXbook.
